# Tic-tac-toe

This is the classic Tic-tac-toe, written in Rust. The only crate it uses is
ncurses, for creating a text user interface.  To try, make sure you have both
`cargo` and `git` installed, and then run the following:

# Building
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/knarkzel/tictactoe
cd tictactoe/
cargo run
```

# Keyboard-controls

Use the arrow keys to navigate the cursor, and press ENTER to place.
